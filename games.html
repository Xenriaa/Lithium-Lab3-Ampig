			<p> Zenless Zone Zero (or zzz) is a hack n slash type game made by Hoyoverse, where you chain your attacks to gain points and defeat enemies. With a gacha system similar to genshin impact, You obtain agents by pulling on their banner. You do commisions to obtain dennies so you can upgrade your agents and their weapons. For a game that just released it has alot of things to do, such as Trials (shiyu defense) Hard weekly challenges (hollow zero), and fun characters such as Billy kid. </p>
